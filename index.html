            <h2>What has happened?</h2>

            <p>JEDD Mason, our benevolent emperor, has convened a session of the Universal Free Alliance and offered the following commandment (translated into English by his Mycroft Canner):</p>
            <p>"To question the wisdom of one's creator is an act of impiety that humanity has often been guilty of, but I must today ask that you do it again. While it is not your place to question My Peer who created your world, it is My place, as His Peer, to criticize His works, and by the laws which bind me here the method I must use to critique a criminal whose crimes are so beyond any system designed for humans to judge themselves is that system which you call 'Terra Ignota.' Neither his Asclepius, nor his Apollo, nor my Dominic, the three best suited to speak on my peer's behalf are available to do so. My Mycroft is shaped by Him more than most, but he is not capable of un-harming himself."</p>
            
            <p>"I therefore nominate any mason who is willing to aid their creator and obey their emperor to speak, as so many have spoken, with the words He places within you, as His Advocatus Dei. I likewise ask that any human who wishes to speak against their creator as Advocatus Humanitas consider their choice well, for though I am your emperor he will forever be your Maker, and my ability to protect you will be limited always by His Plan."</p>

            <h2>What are the charges?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Violation of the first law, second law, third law, fourth law, and fifth law for inflicting all of humanity's sufferings upon them.</li>
                <li>Violation of the first law, second law, third law, fourth law, and fifth law for starting the Trunk War.</li>
                <li>Violation of the first law, second law, third law, fourth law, and fifth law for starting the Remaker War.</li>
                <li>Violation of the sixth law for ignoring all prayers save those of JEDD Mason.</li>
                <li>Violation of the Eighth law for invoking the rage of man while not making Himself subject to any of man's laws.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Currently Unsettled Complications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="stars">Is God a minor, or has He completed the adulthood competency exam millions of times through his human avatars?</li>
                <li class="stars">Is God responsible for anything, did He know how the universe would turn out when He made it?</li>
                <li class="stars">Can we hold God responsible for everything that has ever happened, or just what seem to be His direct interventions (the creation of Bridger and all that followed from that)?</li>
                <li class="stars">Should our laws treat Gods differently than humans?</li>

            <h2>Procedural Directives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="stars">The works of Mycroft Canner are to be considered authoritatively correct on the affairs of mankind which he observed, though his speculations on the divine are purely speculation.</li>
                <li class="stars">Before the trial, the Advocatus Dei will pick the hive membership of two of the judges, and the Advocatus Humanitas will pick the hive membership of the third.</li>
                <li class="stars">The format of the trial will consist of 10 minutes for the prosecution to lay out their argument, 5 minutes for the judges to question it, 10 minutes for the defense to lay out their argument, then 15 minutes where the judges may ask any questions to any side they wish. During this last period, the advocates may only address the judge, not each other.</li>
                <li class="stars">After arguments have been presented and questioning have been completed, the judges have 20 minutes to come to a verdict. If all the judges disagree on a matter, no punitive or legislative action will be taken. Consent of two of the judges can render punishments against the accused and submit matters for further consideration and deliberation to the Senate. Consensus of all three judges on a matter allows for reinterpretations of any law, even the Black Laws.</li>
                <li class="stars">Any technical or procedural question that needs answering during the trial will be ruled on instantly and unilaterally by a neutral third party (which will be whichever one of Johnny or Martyr or Dianne didn't get picked as a judge).</li>
